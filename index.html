        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          This blog explores the history and art of Greco-Buddhist sculpture and
          Hindu art. Greco-Buddhist sculpture refers to the art produced in
          Gandhara, a region that spanned parts of present-day Pakistan and
          Afghanistan, which fused Greek and Buddhist styles. The Mathura School
          of art developed in the ancient city of Mathura in northern India and
          produced some of the finest examples of Indian art. The Gupta period,
          from the 4th to 6th century CE, is often referred to as the Golden Age
          of India and produced some of the most exquisite examples of Hindu
          art.

        <h2>Gandhara School</h2>
        <p>
          The Gandhara School of art emerged in the 1st century CE and reached
          its peak in the 2nd to 4th centuries CE. It was located in the
          Gandhara region of present-day Pakistan and Afghanistan, which was a
          crossroads of trade and culture between the East and the West. The
          art produced by the Gandhara School fused Greek and Buddhist styles,
          reflecting the influence of the Hellenistic world on Buddhist art.
          Some of the notable features of Gandhara sculpture include the use of
          Greco-Roman techniques such as naturalism, individualized portraits,
          and drapery, as well as Buddhist motifs such as lotus flowers,
          bodhisattvas, and the Buddha himself.

        <h2>Mathura School</h2>
        <p>
          The Mathura School of art developed in the ancient city of Mathura in
          northern India from the 2nd century BCE to the 12th century CE. The
          art produced by the Mathura School is known for its realism, vitality,
          and expressiveness. Some of the notable features of Mathura sculpture
          include the use of red sandstone, the depiction of human figures with
          delicate features and graceful postures, and the depiction of
          celestial beings such as yakshas and yakshis. The Mathura School also
          produced some of the earliest depictions of the Buddha in India.

        <h2>Hindu Art of the Gupta Period</h2>
        <p>The Gupta period (320-550 CE) is considered a "golden age" of Indian civilization, marked by advances in art, science, and literature. Hindu art during this time was characterized by a focus on religious themes, particularly the deities Vishnu, Shiva, and Devi.</p>
        <p>The Gupta artists emphasized realism in their depictions of the gods, creating sculptures that were not only aesthetically pleasing, but also conveyed the divine power and grace of the deities. They also incorporated symbolism and intricate details into their work, such as the use of mudras (hand gestures) and ornaments.</p>
        <p>One of the most famous examples of Gupta period art is the statue of the goddess Uma, also known as the "Golden Goddess of the River Ganges." This bronze statue, which dates back to the 5th century, depicts Uma standing on a lotus flower and holding a water jar. The statue's intricate details, from Uma's jewelry to the flow of her garments, showcase the skill of Gupta period artists.</p>
        <p>Another notable example of Gupta art is the Dashavatara Temple in Deogarh, which features intricate carvings of the ten incarnations of Vishnu. The temple's carvings showcase the Gupta artists' attention to detail and their ability to convey complex stories through their work.</p>
